# stopwatch
This stopwatch can count up to hours. Once 24 hours have passed by, the stopwatch appears to restart again. Initially the stopwatch is at 0 and then pressing KEY[1] causes it to start. Pressing pushbutton KEY[1] on the FPGA board freezes the stopwatch when it is running or continues the stopwatch when it is frozen. Pressing KEY[0] resets the stopwatch where it is frozen at 0 until you press KEY[1]. I used the 50MHz clock of the FPGA board to increment the time. I wrote a module for a clock divider so that the stopwatch would increment at seconds and not the natural frequency on the clock.
